# i3-gaps dotfiles

This is my first attempt at creating a rice using i3-gaps, polybar and some other software but I think this these are messy and, since I had the oppurtinity, I started another rice well-thought and available at [dotfiles-bspwm](https://github.com/FedericoAntoniazzi/dotfiles-bspwm).

Probably I won't touch these files for long time so don't expect any upgrade :)

## Programs
- i3-gaps
- picom-ibhagwan
- polybar
- rofi
- feh
- lightdm
- kitty
- flameshot
- amixer
- brightnessctl
- neovim

### Neovim
I think I've spent more time on adding features to vim than any other config but now is really messy and I prefer starting again from scratch. It was also my first attempt at using it so many mappings may look horrible.
